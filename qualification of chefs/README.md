## Chef Experience Analysis
The Chef Experience Analysis project is a Python script designed to provide insights into the income potential of chefs based on their years of culinary experience. Leveraging a simulated dataset, the script performs a comprehensive analysis and produces visualizations to help understand the distribution of chefs' expertise and its impact on their earnings.

## Project Overview
### Data Generation
The project begins by generating a distribution of chefs' counts, simulating their experience levels using a log-normal distribution. This foundational dataset serves as the basis for subsequent analyses.

## Visualizations
1. Distribution Bar Plot:

    - The script creates a bar plot to illustrate the distribution of chefs based on their experience. This provides a quick overview of the composition of chefs in the dataset.
2. Scatter Plot with Regression Lines:

    - A scatter plot is generated to showcase the average values of chefs' experience over time. Two regression lines are included, highlighting trends for chefs with 1-8 years and 9-16 years of experience.
3. Income Intervals Visualization:

    - The project visualizes income intervals for chefs in both experience intervals. The analysis considers a base monthly salary and explores potential additional income, providing a more nuanced understanding of chefs' financial prospects.
## Results
The script calculates and prints the average chef's potential extra income for each year of experience. This information can offer valuable insights for individuals planning their culinary careers or stakeholders interested in understanding the  financial dynamics of the culinary industry.
